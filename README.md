# Analyzing-Crime-fluctuations-in-Toronto
Using R, We will analyze the fluctuations among different crime types in Toronto throughout the last 10 years

## Central Research Question

By utilizing the data provided by the Toronto Police Service to investigate, this study will aim to answer:

 **How has the rate of total number of victims of crimes in Toronto changed from 2014 to 2020?**

We will aim to better understand if Toronto has become safer in the seven year span by investigating whether or not the total number of victims of crimes has increased, decreased or stagnated through the years. It is also important to distinguish between male and female victims of crime to discern if one sex has a lower or higher rate of being victimized by crimes compared to the other. Before delving into to data, through the Statistics Canada study in which women reported to feeling more unsafe walking alone at night compared to men [4] and Toronto having an all time high rank in The Economist's list of the safest cities in the world in 2021 [2]; in this study we hypothesize that from 2014 to 2020 Toronto will have seen negative trend of crime rates with women having a higher rate of being a victim of a crime compared to men.
